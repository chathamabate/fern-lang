We are compiling to x86 16-bit real mode machine code.

Notes on Segments:

    SS - Used by all stack operations
         (And when BP is used as base register)

    DS - Used by all data operations (except the following...)
    ES - Is used as "String destination segment"

Notes on Registers:

    General Purpose 8-bit Registers
    AL, CL, DL, BL, AH, CH, DH, BH

    General Purpose 16-bit Registers
    AX, CX, DX, BX, SP, BP, SI, DI

    Segment Registers
    ES, CS, SS, DS

Notes on Effective Addresses:

    Remember that BP and BX are refered to as "Base Registers".
    BP indexes into the stack segment SS.
    BX indexes into the data segment DS.

        8-bit constant offset   (DS)
        16-bit constant offset  (DS)
        Only Base or Index: BX, SI, DI (DS)     BP (SS)
        (Base/Index + Displacement)
        Base + Index: BX + SI, BX + DI (DS)     BP + SI, BP + DI (SS)
        (Base + Index + Displacement)

    In the "Notable Instructions" section, all the above forms are considered
    "memory".

Notable Instructions:

    These are going to be the instructions supported by this assembler.
    There are many more instructions available. They will not be included
    for simplicity.

    Control:
        CALL - Call a procedure.
        RET - Return from a procedure.
        JMP - Unconditional jump.
        J__ - Conditional jump.
        LOOP__ - Conditional looping.
    
    Interrupts:
        INT - Call an interrupt.

    Processor Control:
        STC - Set carry flag.
        CLC - Clear carry flag.
        CMC - Complement carry flag. 
        STD - Set direction flag.
        CLD - Clear direction flag.
        STI - Set interrupt enable flag.
        CLI - Clear interrupt enable flag.
        HLT - Halt until interrupt or reset.
        NOP - no op.

Typical Op Code Construction:

          Byte 1     |     Byte 2      |     Byte 3    |     Byte 4     |  Byte 5  |   Byte 6  |
      (6)    (1) (1) | (2)   (3)   (3) | Low Disp/Data | High Disp/Data | Low Data | High Data |
    Op-Code | D | W  | MOD | REG | R/M |               |                |          |           |

Single Bit Fields:

    D - Direction 
        0 - REG is source
        1 - REG is destination
